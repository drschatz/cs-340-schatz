Objects, types, and variables all work together to help us write programs in C++. Objects have a type and are referred to by their variable name. For example,

`int x = 9;`

This line of code is asking the computer for a space in memory for an object of type int that is currently the value 9. This object can be accessed later by its variable name, x.

## Useful Primitive Types

|     int      |                                                            A whole number from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.                                                             |     int x = -65;      |
| unsigned int |                                                              A positive whole number from 0 to 4,294,967,295.                                                               | unsigned int var = 9; |
|     bool     |                                                                 true (the value 1) or false (the value 0).                                                                  |   bool temp = true;   |
|     char     | A character. See [ASCII table](https://www.asciitable.com/) for possible characters. Every character has an equivalent integer value which can be found in the ASCII table. |     char k = 'H';     |
|    double    |                                                                      A number with 15 or less digits.                                                                       |  double dub = 54.67;  |

_NOTE: *Later in the course you will learn about a few more types including pointers, arrays, references, and classes. For now, focus on the ones in the table above.*_
