# Data Structures in Python

Learn about Python's built-in data structures.

## Lists

Lists are ordered, mutable sequences:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
fruits.append("date")
print(fruits[0])  # "apple"
```

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries store key-value pairs:

```python
student = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 20,
    "major": "CS"
}
print(student["name"])
```

## Tuples

Tuples are immutable sequences:

```python
coordinates = (10, 20)
x, y = coordinates
```

## Sets

Sets contain unique elements:

```python
numbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}
print(numbers)  # {1, 2, 3, 4}
```
