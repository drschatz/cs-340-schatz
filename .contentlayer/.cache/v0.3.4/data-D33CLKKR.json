Campuswire accounts are added the business day after you enroll.\n\nTo request an extension or get additional support based on extenuating circumstances, please email Prof. Schatz directly. \n\n## Course Description\n\nBasics of computer systems. Number representations, assembly/machine language, abstract models of processors (fetch/execute, memory hierarchy), processes/process control, simple memory management, file I/O and directories, network programming, usage of cloud services.\n\n**Credit Hours:** 3  \n**Prerequisites:** CS 225\n\n## Course Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nCS 340 meets twice a week for in-person lectures. Roughly each week you will have a mastery-based homework that allows you to practice and master the technical concepts. After mastering the concepts, you then apply them in the weekly assignments (MPs). Throughout the semester, you will:\n\n- Learn how computers work from the hardware up\n- Practice systems programming in C\n- Build networked applications\n\nThe course will be roughly divided into two parts:\n- **Part 1** covers how computers are designed and operate, from electrons up to C. This part also covers concurrency and synchronization, including the basics of operating systems and threads.\n- **Part 2** covers interaction between systems written by different parties, including the internet, and various [as-a-Service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_a_service) models such as containerization and web services.\n\n### Content Delivery\n\nAll of the course content will be posted on this website. While some draft content might appear ahead of schedule, in general content will be posted shortly before it is used in class.\n\n### Related Courses\n\nThis course has significant overlap with CS 233 and CS 341. CS 233 and CS 341 invest 8 credit hours in going into detail on topics that CS 340 covers in 2 credit hours. Our briefer overview is sufficient for many purposes, but leaves out details needed for hardware-aware application domains such as embedded systems and cybersecurity. The remaining credit hour in 340 explores how to use containers and service architectures to create internet applications.\n\n## Class Meetings\n\n### Schedule\n\n**Lectures:** Tuesday/Thursday, 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM  \n**Location:** Room 100, Materials Science & Eng Bld\n\nAll lectures are recorded and posted on MediaSpace.\n\n### Absences\n\nFor most class meetings, absences are permitted at no penalty and require no notice. Please do not attend class meetings if you are feeling ill.\n\nFor the following, if you cannot attend, please let Prof. Schatz know as soon as possible. Each situation will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis:\n- The 3 Exams (in the CBTF)\n- Final Project Check-Off (TBD)\n\nExamples of common reasons for an absence for one of these meetings to be excused include illness, family emergency, university-approved events, or religious observances.\n\n### Tutoring Hours\n\nSee [the schedule](schedule.html#tutoring-hours) for when tutoring hours take place. One-off adjustments based on staff availability may be announced on Campuswire. All tutoring hours are held in the lower level of Siebel. \n\nTutoring hours are a place to receive help on misunderstandings, MPs, and homeworks. Additionally, it's a great place to meet classmates and staff! Feel free to stop by even if you don't have a specific question.\n\n\n# Assignments and Grades\n\n**55% - Exams**\n    - 3 exams at around 18% each.\n    - Exams are 50 minutes and given in the CBTF for ONE day (always a TODO). The TODO class session will be canceled for the week of each exam.\n    - Each exam will have a second chance exam available the following week, also in the CBTF. Your score for the exam, if you take the second chance exam, will be 80% of your higher scored exam and 20% of your lower scored exam. \n\n**35% - Machine Projects (MPs)**\n    - Roughly one per week.\n    - Most MPs are submitted on PrairieLearn, with one MP requiring a tutoring hours check-off.\n    - Some MPs will include an extra credit opportunity which will be clearly indicated in the MP description and will be awarded only if you got 100% on the rest of the MP.\n\n**5% - Final Project Check-Off**\n\t- The final project will be checked off during the university-assigned finals period. Attendance is required. \n\n**5% - Homework Assignments**\n    - Given weekly in PrairieLearn.\n    - Each exam will replace a preceding, relvant homework score (if it would improve your grade). \n\n**Extra Credit for In-Class Exercises**\n    -  0.05% is given for completing all in-class exercises for a specific class period.\n    - You must be present for the entire class period to earn the extra credit. Pretending to attend class to get the extra credit is an academic integrity violation. It will result in all extra credit being removed and a 10% final grade deduction.\n\n### Letter Grades\n\nLetter grades are based on a scale of percentages where 90s are As, 80s are Bs, 70s are Cs, and 60s are Ds:\n- **A:** 93.33% - 100%\n- **A-:** 90% - 93.33%\n- **B+:** 86.67% - 90%\n- **B:** 83.33% - 86.67%\n- **B-:** 80% - 83.33%\n- **C+:** 76.67% - 80%\n- **C:** 73.33% - 76.67%\n- **C-:** 70% - 73.33%\n- **D+:** 66.67% - 70%\n- **D:** 63.33% - 66.67%\n- **D-:** 60% - 63.33%\n- **F:** Below 60%\n\n## MP Policies\n\n### Guidelines\n\nMany of the MPs are challenging. Expect to invest significant time over several days for each MP.\n\nOur goal with each MP is to give you hands-on practice with the material covered in lecture. It is not to give us working code, nor learn by looking at working code.\n\nThis leads to the following concrete policies:\n\n- **Attend lecture before coding.** Lecture often includes MP-related content. Please review that prior to asking for help.\n- **Design and type all your own code.** Search engines, AI systems, tutors, and friends are not permitted sources of MP code.\n- **Share tips, not steps.** It is helpful to share tips like \"fseek is helpful.\" It is harmful to share steps like \"add a for loop that uses fread with a 4 byte buffer, converts to an int, and then fseeks that far.\" Figuring out the steps yourself is part of your learning experience.\n- **Always use a debugger.** MP1 shows you how to use a debugger. For each subsequent MP, if your code is not doing what you expected it to do, run it in the debugger to see how it is doing the wrong thing.\n- **If you need help, come to tutoring hours!**\n\n### Timeliness and Deadlines\n\nDeadlines matter, but life also happens! We have 3 policies around deadlines:\n\n- If you miss an MP deadline by 24 hours or less, submit anyway. We'll note that you were late but won't dock your GPA. However, course staff will not be able to help you with the MP past the posted deadline.\n- For homework, exams, and the final project check-off we do not accept late work.\n- The professors may approve exceptions to these rules via email in cases of extenuating circumstances. Please contact the professors as soon as possible for full consideration.\n\n## Computer-Based Testing Facility\n\n### CBTF Policies\n\nThis course uses the Grainger College of Engineering's Computer-Based Testing Facility for its exams. This course offering has a SINGLE day to take each exam, NOT a 3-day window. Each exam is scheduled for a TODO and that corresponding TODO class is cancelled.\n\nThe policies of the CBTF are the policies of this course, and academic integrity infractions related to the CBTF are infractions in this course.\n\n### Accommodations\n\nIf you have accommodations identified by the Division of Rehabilitation-Education Services (DRES) for exams, please submit your Letter of Accommodations (LOA) through the [CBTF website](https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students/dres) as soon as possible. It can take up to five days for your LOA to be processed and if you make a reservation before your LOA has been processed, your reservation will not include your testing accommodations and you will be required to reschedule. This must be done each semester you use the CBTF.\n\n### During Exams\n\nIf you have any issue during an exam, inform the proctor immediately. Work with the proctor to resolve the issue at the time before logging off. If you do not inform a proctor of a problem during the test then you forfeit all rights to addressing the problem you experienced during your exam.\n\nTake the [CBTF Orientation](https://go.illinois.edu/student-orientation) (10 minutes) and review all instructions on the [CBTF website](https://cbtf.illinois.edu/students) before your first exam.\n\n## Academic Integrity\n\n### Collaboration\n\nCollaboration includes giving or receiving information from others, including AI systems, websites, tutors, or other students.\n\n- **Homework and in-class collaboration** is permitted provided that each student ends up able to explain why their correct answers are correct.\n- **Exam collaboration** is not permitted.\n- **MP collaboration** is not permitted if it involves giving or receiving full or partial solutions. MP collaboration that does not share solutions is permitted if it focuses on shared learning.\n\n### AI Policy\n\n**You cannot use AI to write code for you or give you direct answers.**\n\n#### Observations about collaborating with AI\n\nAI is a great tool for searching for documentation on unfamiliar libraries. Queries like \"how do I download a webpage using aiohttp\" are likely to provide useful information.\n\nDon't engage in prohibited collaboration with AI, but also be cautious in how much permitted collaboration you do with it. If it's not giving answers that align with what we've discussed in class, stop before you get more confused, and seek human help instead.\n\n### Consequences\n\nIf a student is detected engaging in academic dishonesty on an assignment or exam in CS 340 (including violating the collaboration or other course policies, abusing computer resources, lying, cheating, or stealing), the following will occur:\n\n- The case will be brought to the college's academic integrity process\n- All points will be lost on the assignment\n- All extra credit will be removed\n- The final course grade will be lowered by one whole letter grade (10 percentage points)\n\nA second incident, or any cheating on an exam, results in an automatic F in the course.\n\n## Campus Resources\n\n### Mental Health\n\nSignificant stress, mood changes, excessive worry, substance/alcohol misuse or interferences in eating or sleep can have an impact on academic performance, social development, and emotional wellbeing. The University of Illinois offers a variety of confidential services including individual and group counseling, crisis intervention, psychiatric services, and specialized screenings which are covered through the Student Health Fee. If you or someone you know experiences any of the above mental health concerns, it is strongly encouraged to contact or visit any of the University's resources provided below. Getting help is a smart and courageous thing to do for yourself and for those who care about you.\n\n- **Counseling Center:** (217) 333-3704, 610 East John Street, Champaign\n- **McKinley Mental Health:** (217) 333-2705\n- **National Suicide Prevention Lifeline:** (800) 273-8255\n- **Rosecrance Crisis Line:** (217) 359-4141 (24/7, confidential)\n\nThis statement is approved by the University of Illinois Counseling Center.\n\n### Anti-Racism and Inclusivity\n\nThe Grainger College of Engineering is committed to the creation of an anti-racist, inclusive community that welcomes diversity along a number of dimensions, including, but not limited to, race, ethnicity and national origins, gender and gender identity, sexuality, disability status, class, age, or religious beliefs. The College recognizes that we are learning together in the midst of the Black Lives Matter movement, that Black, Hispanic, and Indigenous voices and contributions have largely either been excluded from, or not recognized in, science and engineering, and that both overt racism and micro-aggressions threaten the well-being of our students and our university community.\n\nThe effectiveness of this course is dependent upon each of us to create a safe and encouraging learning environment that allows for the open exchange of ideas while also ensuring equitable opportunities and respect for all of us. Everyone is expected to help establish and maintain an environment where students, staff, and faculty can contribute without fear of personal ridicule, or intolerant or offensive language. If you witness or experience racism, discrimination, micro-aggressions, or other offensive behavior, you are encouraged to bring this to the attention of the course director if you feel comfortable. You can also report these behaviors to the [Bias Assessment and Response Team (BART)](https://bart.illinois.edu/). Based on your report, BART members will follow up and reach out to students to make sure they have the support they need to be healthy and safe. If the reported behavior also violates university policy, staff in the Office for Student Conflict Resolution may respond as well and will take appropriate action.\n\n### Community of Care\n\nAs members of the Illinois community, we each have a responsibility to express care and concern for one another. If you come across a classmate whose behavior concerns you, whether in regards to their well-being or yours, we encourage you to refer this behavior to the [Student Assistance Center](http://odos.illinois.edu/community-of-care/referral/) (217-333-0050). Based on your report, the staff in the Student Assistance Center reaches out to students to make sure they have the support they need to be healthy and safe.\n\nFurther, we understand the impact that struggles with mental health can have on your experience at Illinois. Significant stress, strained relationships, anxiety, excessive worry, alcohol/drug problems, a loss of motivation, or problems with eating and/or sleeping can all interfere with optimal academic performance. We encourage all students to reach out to talk with someone, and we want to make sure you are aware that you can access mental health support at [McKinley Health Center](https://mckinley.illinois.edu/) or the [Counseling Center](https://counselingcenter.illinois.edu/). For urgent matters during business hours, no appointment is needed to contact the Counseling Center. For mental health emergencies, you can call 911.\n\n### FERPA\n\nAny student who has suppressed their directory information pursuant to Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) should self-identify to the instructors to ensure protection of the privacy of their attendance in this course. See the [FERPA website](https://registrar.illinois.edu/academic-records/ferpa/) for more information.\n",

The remaining credit hour in 340 explores how to use containers and service architectures to create internet applications.\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:50,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.h2,{id:\"class-meetings\",children:(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#class-meetings\",children:\"Class Meetings\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\"},this)},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:52,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.h3,{id:\"schedule\",children:(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#schedule\",children:\"Schedule\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\"},this)},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:54,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.p,{children:[(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.strong,{children:\"Lectures:\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:56,columnNumber:1},this),\" Tuesday/Thursday, 12:30 PM - 1:45 PM\",(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.br,{},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:56,columnNumber:51},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.strong,{children:\"Location:\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:57,columnNumber:1},this),\" Room 100, Materials Science & Eng Bld\"]},void 0,!0,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:56,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.p,{children:\"All lectures are recorded and posted on MediaSpace.\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:59,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.h3,{id:\"absences\",children:(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.a,{className:\"anchor\",href:\"#absences\",children:\"Absences\"},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\"},this)},void 0,!1,{fileName:\"/Users/drschatz/Documents/340-Sp26/new_web/cs-340-schatz/content/_mdx_bundler_entry_point-5ff42084-b366-4bda-a7af-a016a66cb2f7.mdx\",lineNumber:61,columnNumber:1},this),`\n`,(0,n.jsxDEV)(e.p,{children:\"For most class meetings, absences are permitted at no penalty and require no notice.

          "raw": "\nThis is not a full MP; it is primarily testing your setup and ensuring you are ready for subsequent MPs.\nIt is **dramatically easier** than other MPs.\nDon't plan your time on other MPs based on this one.\n\nThe purposes of this MP are:\n\n1. Ensure you are set up to do other C-language MPs in this course.\n2. Have you see some of the tools the VS Code debugger can do.\n\nIs it possible to create the required `gif.c` without doing these two things? Yes. Should you do that? No.\n\n# Set up your environment\n\nFollow the directions on the MP environment setup page. We'll only use the local toolchain in this MP.\n\n# Fetch starter code\n\nWe have some initial code for your `mp0` for you to get started. Download it from `mp0.zip` and unzip it on your computer into the `cs340` directory you created during the environment setup.\n\n# Use Visual Studio Code\n\nVisual Studio Code (more often called VS Code) is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) with many features shared with other IDEs. Learning to use it well will help you feel comfortable in other IDEs you may use in the future.\n\n## Projects\n\nIDEs have the notion of projects, which contain a set of files related to a single task or program. Typically, these reside in a folder and all of its subfolders. In this class, each MP will be its own project, meaning you need to open VS Code in `mp0` or `mp1` or the like, not in some parent folder that contains them all.\n\nA folder that is set up to be a VS Code project will have inside of it a folder named `.vscode`. In many systems files and folders with names that start with a `.` are hidden from view.\n\nTo open the `mp0` folder in VS Code, do one of the following:\n\n- From a terminal, `cd` into the `mp0` folder and run `code .`\n- Inside of VS Code, use File → Open Folder to open a new folder.\n\n## Integrated Terminal\n\nIDEs give access to the terminal, but often add configuration so that it's got everything needed to build the project ready to use. To open VS Code's integrated terminal, use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+~.\n\nUsing the integrated terminal, let's verify you are all set up for running C programs by doing the following:\n\n- On your terminal, run `make` to compile the provided code.\n- If you receive any errors, read the error messages. They will often be helpful to describe what's going wrong. If you're stuck here, reach out to get help!\n\n## Visual Debugger\n\nIDEs provide a user interface over the normal debugger tools for your language. In VS Code, the debugger tool to use and how to attach it to the visual debugger is defined in `.vscode/launch.json`. Designing these configuration files is not a goal of this course, so we provide them for each MP.\n\nOur `launch.json` files for `C` programs use `Makefile`s, one of the oldest and best-established command-line build management tools. You can compile your code from the command line by typing `make` and run any tests we provided by typing `make test`. The `launch.json` will do these two commands but attach a debugger to the running code, and may also have other commands for handling specific cases in some MPs.\n\nYou can run VS Code's debugger in two ways:\n\n- On the left side of Visual Studio Code, find the \"Run and Debug\" Interface\n- Once on the \"Run and Debug\" interface, find the green \"Debug\" arrow to start your program with a visual debugger\n\nDepending on the project, it may ask you to pick a launch configuration to run and may ask for per-run configuration.\n\nFor MP0, start by accepting the defaults when you run the debugger. After a moment the debugger will pause execution because of a segmentation fault.\n\n# Debug the Code\n\nTo help you learn how to use the debugger, we provide a version of `gif.c` that has multiple bugs inserted. Each bug is designed to help you see the value of a different aspect of the debugger.\n\nEach bug can be fixed by editing a single line of code in `gif.c`: all but one by commenting out a line and the last by making one change to a line. That's obviously not true of most real bugs: they tend to span many lines and even many files. Our goal in this MP is not to show you what real bugs look like, it's to show you what the debugger can do.\n\n## Segmentation fault\n\nA segmentation fault occurs when code tries to dereference a pointer to memory that is not in use. Memory references occur with the `*address`, `address->`, and `address[offset]` operators. Debuggers are very good at locating segmentation faults, but the bug that caused the fault is often in an earlier line that computed the address (or failed to do so).\n\nMP0 has several segmentation faults.\n\n## Stack Smashing\n\nStack smashing occurs when code tries to change memory that belongs to a different function's activation record.\n\nRecall that each function is given a region of memory on the call stack, called an activation record, in which to store its arguments and local variables. The function that called the current function's activation record is right after the current activation record in memory. In between these two the compiler inserts special guards to make sure memory accesses don't cross the boundary: if they do, that's stack smashing.\n\nStack smashing is one of several bugs that will have information printed to the terminal, not just alerted in the debugger.\n\nMP0 has only one stack smashing error.\n\n## Call Stack Inspection\n\nWhen the debugger pauses, either on an error or because you added a breakpoint, the \"Run and Debug\" window shows a wealth of useful debugging information.\n\nOne panel is labeled \"Call Stack\". It will list the function calls that were called leading to where your program is currently paused. You can click on them to jump to their location in code.\n\nIn a call stack, the top is the most recent function called. The call stack is very useful for finding infinite recursion if you see the same function name again and again and again. You will want to reference the call stack for several bugs in `mp0`.\n\n## Pause-and-step\n\nIf there's an infinite loop, the program will appear to make no progress. In that case, you can pause the debugger and step through the code to see what is happening.\n\nPressing the left-most \"Pause\" button will pause the execution of the program and provide you information about the current point of execution. When the program is paused:\n\n- You can hover over variables to see the values their hold\n- You can view the call stack and other debugging information\n- You can use the control window to step through your code line-by-line\n\n## Breakpoints\n\nWhen a program is doing the wrong thing, the most common approach to debug is to set a breakpoint. This means picking a line of code and telling the debugger to pause when it reaches that line (before it runs it).\n\nTo set a breakpoint, click on the space immediately to the left of the line number. A bright red dot will appear to indicate that an active breakpoint is set.\n\nIn the example above, execution will pause after running Line 834 but before running Line 835. Since it's paused, you can inspect all of the variables at the exact moment before running Line 835. If you resume the program and the breakpoint is encountered again, it will pause again.\n\nIf you've done print-based debugging before, that's a sloppy way of trying to approximate a breakpoint + hovering over variables without using a debugger.\n\n## Watches and Beyond\n\nSometimes a variable changes many times, with the information you need to debug it appearing and then disappearing later. There are multiple debugging tools for these situations, which can get quite involved; two of the simpler such tools are watches and conditional breakpoints.\n\nIn MP0 we have one bug that could benefit from these tools, though it could also be debugged with a breakpoint and stepping if you are patient. After you've fixed all the obvious bugs the code will run but it won't do very much.\n\nThere's still another bug: logic error in the resulting behavior, one of the hardest kinds of bugs to find because nothing crashes. To help you find it, there's a secret message explaining how to fix it inside the global `message` variable, but that message is only there part-way through a run of the program. Find the message and make the final fix to complete the MP.\n\n# Submission and Grading\n\nOnly edit `gif.c`, none of the other files we provide. `gif.c` is the only file you can upload so if you change anything else your code won't work the same for you as it does for us.\n\nWhen you think you are done, `make test` will run all our tests and report what grade we think you've earned.\n\nOnce you've passed all the tests, submit your code on the upload site.\n\nThis MP has very low weight, all-or-nothing grading, and accepts late submissions at no grade penalty.\n\nThe final line of output from `make test` will be `SCORE: 0 / 1` or `SCORE: 1 / 1`: this tells you how much credit you'll get if you submit this code.\n\nYou may submit as often as you like, including replacing old submissions. This is true of all MPs. Only your last submission (prior to the end of the late submission window) will be included in your grade.\n",

Designing these configuration files is not a goal of this course, so we provide them for each MP.</p>\n<p>Our <code>launch.json</code> files for <code>C</code> programs use <code>Makefile</code>s, one of the oldest and best-established command-line build management tools. You can compile your code from the command line by typing <code>make</code> and run any tests we provided by typing <code>make test</code>. The <code>launch.json</code> will do these two commands but attach a debugger to the running code, and may also have other commands for handling specific cases in some MPs.</p>\n<p>You can run VS Code's debugger in two ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On the left side of Visual Studio Code, find the \"Run and Debug\" Interface</li>\n<li>Once on the \"Run and Debug\" interface, find the green \"Debug\" arrow to start your program with a visual debugger</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Depending on the project, it may ask you to pick a launch configuration to run and may ask for per-run configuration.</p>\n<p>For MP0, start by accepting the defaults when you run the debugger. After a moment the debugger will pause execution because of a segmentation fault.</p>\n<h1>Debug the Code</h1>\n<p>To help you learn how to use the debugger, we provide a version of <code>gif.c</code> that has multiple bugs inserted. Each bug is designed to help you see the value of a different aspect of the debugger.</p>\n<p>Each bug can be fixed by editing a single line of code in <code>gif.c</code>: all but one by commenting out a line and the last by making one change to a line. That's obviously not true of most real bugs: they tend to span many lines and even many files. Our goal in this MP is not to show you what real bugs look like, it's to show you what the debugger can do.</p>\n<h2>Segmentation fault</h2>\n<p>A segmentation fault occurs when code tries to dereference a pointer to memory that is not in use. Memory references occur with the <code>*address</code>, <code>address-></code>, and <code>address[offset]</code> operators. Debuggers are very good at locating segmentation faults, but the bug that caused the fault is often in an earlier line that computed the address (or failed to do so).</p>\n<p>MP0 has several segmentation faults.</p>\n<h2>Stack Smashing</h2>\n<p>Stack smashing occurs when code tries to change memory that belongs to a different function's activation record.</p>\n<p>Recall that each function is given a region of memory on the call stack, called an activation record, in which to store its arguments and local variables. The function that called the current function's activation record is right after the current activation record in memory. In between these two the compiler inserts special guards to make sure memory accesses don't cross the boundary: if they do, that's stack smashing.</p>\n<p>Stack smashing is one of several bugs that will have information printed to the terminal, not just alerted in the debugger.</p>\n<p>MP0 has only one stack smashing error.</p>\n<h2>Call Stack Inspection</h2>\n<p>When the debugger pauses, either on an error or because you added a breakpoint, the \"Run and Debug\" window shows a wealth of useful debugging information.</p>\n<p>One panel is labeled \"Call Stack\". It will list the function calls that were called leading to where your program is currently paused. You can click on them to jump to their location in code.</p>\n<p>In a call stack, the top is the most recent function called. The call stack is very useful for finding infinite recursion if you see the same function name again and again and again. You will want to reference the call stack for several bugs in <code>mp0</code>.</p>\n<h2>Pause-and-step</h2>\n<p>If there's an infinite loop, the program will appear to make no progress. In that case, you can pause the debugger and step through the code to see what is happening.</p>\n<p>Pressing the left-most \"Pause\" button will pause the execution of the program and provide you information about the current point of execution. When the program is paused:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You can hover over variables to see the values their hold</li>\n<li>You can view the call stack and other debugging information</li>\n<li>You can use the control window to step through your code line-by-line</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Breakpoints</h2>\n<p>When a program is doing the wrong thing, the most common approach to debug is to set a breakpoint. This means picking a line of code and telling the debugger to pause when it reaches that line (before it runs it).</p>\n<p>To set a breakpoint, click on the space immediately to the left of the line number. A bright red dot will appear to indicate that an active breakpoint is set.</p>\n<p>In the example above, execution will pause after running Line 834 but before running Line 835. Since it's paused, you can inspect all of the variables at the exact moment before running Line 835. If you resume the program and the breakpoint is encountered again, it will pause again.</p>\n<p>If you've done print-based debugging before, that's a sloppy way of trying to approximate a breakpoint + hovering over variables without using a debugger.</p>\n<h2>Watches and Beyond</h2>\n<p>Sometimes a variable changes many times, with the information you need to debug it appearing and then disappearing later. There are multiple debugging tools for these situations, which can get quite involved; two of the simpler such tools are watches and conditional breakpoints.</p>\n<p>In MP0 we have one bug that could benefit from these tools, though it could also be debugged with a breakpoint and stepping if you are patient. After you've fixed all the obvious bugs the code will run but it won't do very much.</p>\n<p>There's still another bug: logic error in the resulting behavior, one of the hardest kinds of bugs to find because nothing crashes. To help you find it, there's a secret message explaining how to fix it inside the global <code>message</code> variable, but that message is only there part-way through a run of the program. Find the message and make the final fix to complete the MP.</p>\n<h1>Submission and Grading</h1>\n<p>Only edit <code>gif.c</code>, none of the other files we provide. <code>gif.c</code> is the only file you can upload so if you change anything else your code won't work the same for you as it does for us.</p>\n<p>When you think you are done, <code>make test</code> will run all our tests and report what grade we think you've earned.</p>\n<p>Once you've passed all the tests, submit your code on the upload site.</p>\n<p>This MP has very low weight, all-or-nothing grading, and accepts late submissions at no grade penalty.</p>\n<p>The final line of output from <code>make test</code> will be <code>SCORE: 0 / 1</code> or <code>SCORE: 1 / 1</code>: this tells you how much credit you'll get if you submit this code.</p>\n<p>You may submit as often as you like, including replacing old submissions. This is true of all MPs. Only your last submission (prior to the end of the late submission window) will be included in your grade.</p>"

          "raw": "\nThis is not a full MP; it is primarily testing your setup and ensuring you are ready for subsequent MPs.\nIt is **dramatically easier** than other MPs.\nDon't plan your time on other MPs based on this one.\n\nThis MP has only one goal: to help you understand how C is unlike C++.\n\nWe give you a C++ reference implementation of a doubly-linked list, with a simple driver program.\nWe also give you a C header file and driver program for a C version of the doubly-linked list.\nYour task is to write the corresponding doubly-linked list C source file.\nThis will mostly consist of copying C++ code to the C file, then changing the C++-specific parts to be C-specific instead.\n\n**Don't use AI**\n\nAI systems can do this assignment without any trouble. So can our TAs, others who took this course before, and many other people.\n\nDon't ask them to. Do this assignment yourself.\n\nThis MP is primarily intended to help you understand C so that later MPs will be easier to do. If you have someone or something else do the MP for you, that learning won't happen and you'll find later MPs much harder as a consequence.\n\nYou might find \"C without the ++\" to be a useful resource when working on this MP.\n\n# Initial Files\n\n`mp2.zip` contains a reference C++ implementation, a non-functioning C implementation, and build and testing supports like a Makefile and vscode project files.\n\nThe provided `dll.c` **does not compile** because it does not define the functions required by `dll.h`. Our first recommended step below is to add enough that it does compile.\n\nThe starter file does not include `stdio.h`, and you should not add it. Do not use any printing functions (such as `printf`) in your code. Instead, we recommend using the debugger. That lack of printing will be checked by `make test`, the command used to grade your code.\n\n# Machine Problem\n\nImplement a C version of the provided C++ code.\n\nWe recommend the following flow:\n\n1. Stub out the implementation. That is, do the minimum possible to make it compile, generally by making empty or return-only function bodies.\n\n2. Copy one function body from C++ to C and edit it to remove compiler errors. Pay particular attention to pointers and initialization: C++ calls initializers and destructors automatically which C does not.\n\n3. Repeat until all functions are done.\n\n4. Try it and debug it with the debugger.\n\n## C you will need\n\nYou'll probably want to use `strlen`, `free`, and either `malloc` or `calloc`. Other functions defined in `string.h`, like `strcmp` and `memset`, are also permitted. The tests will verify that those are the only library functions that you use.\n\nYou'll be required to meet all the rules of C. This will be enforced by compiling with the following compiler flags:\n\n**-Wall**\n:   Enable all the warnings, even those that programmers often ignore.\n\n**-Werror**\n:   Makes warnings into errors, refusing to compile if there are warnings.\n\n**-pedantic-errors**\n:   Emit errors for things that the standard specifies but the compiler knows how to ignore.\n\n**-std=c17**\n:   Uses the official 2017 standard version of C, the last version to be widely supported by compilers.\n\nYou must not have any memory errors or leaks. This will be enforced in part using valgrind; the following invocation\n\n```sh\nvalgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./dll_c whatever other arguments you want\n```\n\nmust end with an \"ERROR SUMMARY\" reporting \"0 errors\" and no other error messages.\n\n## Guide to changing C++ into C\n\n### Replace namespaces with name prefixes\n\nIn C++, namespaces help different libraries not collide. In C, the tradition is to prefix every function and global variable name with the same prefix, like `glViewport` instead of just `viewport` in OpenGL or `sqlite3_open` instead of `open` in SQLite.\n\nWe use the prefix `dll` (double linked list) in our provided header file.\n\n### Replace overloads and templates with name suffixes\n\nIn C++, `foo(int)` and `foo(double)` can co-exist; in C they cannot. The traditional solution is to add a type-specific suffix to the function name, like `sqrt(double)` and `sqrtf(float)`. If there's just a single parameter, suffixes based on `printf` percent codes are common; for anything more complicated there's no single pattern.\n\nTemplated functions can be removed in a similar type-suffix way, but if there's more than a few types expected it is more common to replace the templated-type argument with something like a type code and a `void *`.\n\nWe used the suffix `c` for what in C++ was a `<char>` template, and `s` for what was a `<std::string>` template.\n\n### Explicit `this`\n\nC has no built-in object orientation. As long as you are not using inheritance, this is a relatively small obstacle; just add the `this`-argument as the explicit first argument of each method and add a namespace-like renaming.\n\n**Example:**\n\nThis C++ class\n\n```cpp\nclass Pt2D {\n  double x,y;\n  Pt2D(double x, double y) { this.x = x; this.y = y; }\n  void move(double x, double y) { this.x += x; this.y += y; }\n  double theta() { return atan2(y, x); }\n  double r() { return hypot(x,y); }\n};\n```\n\nbecomes this C code: a `.h` file containing\n\n```c\ntypedef struct {\n  double x,y;\n} Pt2D;\nvoid pt2d_init(Pt2D *self, double x, double y);\nvoid pt2d_move(Pt2D *self, double x, double y);\ndouble pt2d_theta(Pt2D *self);\ndouble pt2d_r(Pt2D *self);\n```\n\nand a `.c` file containing\n\n```c\n#include \"the h file you created.h\"\n\nvoid pt2d_init(Pt2D *self, double x, double y) { self->x = x; self->y = y; }\nvoid pt2d_move(Pt2D *self, double x, double y) { self->x += x; self->y += y; }\ndouble pt2d_theta(Pt2D *self) { return atan2(self->y, self->x); }\ndouble pt2d_r(Pt2D *self) { return hypot(self->y, self->x); }\n```\n\nNote the above assumes a two-step creation: allocate, then initialize. If the intent is to always initialize on the heap (like C++'s `new` operator does) then we could instead (or in addition) do something like this:\n\n```c\nPt2D *pt2d_new(double x, double y) {\n  Pt2D *self = malloc(sizeof(Pt2D);\n  self->x = x; self->y = y;\n  return self;\n}\nvoid pt2d_delete(Pt2D *self) { free(self); }\n```\n\n### Language tweaks\n\nReplace `new` with `malloc` + initialization.\n\nReplace `delete` with `free` (preceded by deinitialization if there's a destructor).\n\nReplace `std::string` with `char *`.\n\nReplace operator overloading with explicit function calls: `strcat` instead of `std::string`'s `+` operator, `printf` instead of `cout`'s `<<` operator, and so on.\n\nThere are no `auto` declarations, iterator loops, or lambda expressions in C.\n\nReplace pass-by-reference code with pass-by-pointer, adding needed `*`/`->` operators to make that work.\n\nTo match prevailing style, move where `*`s appear in type declarations. In C it is tradition to write `int *x`, not `int* x` like in C++. It is also traditional to declare multiple pointers per line, like `int *x, *y`.\n\n# Testing Your Program\n\n- Compile with `make`\n- Test with `python3 tests.py`\n    - If this does not run on your computer, you can do what it does manually:\n        1. `make clean` followed by `make dll_c` should create `dll_c`\n        2. `dll_c` and `dll_cpp` should have the same operation as one another, including with the following arguments:\n            - `e`\n            - `e f`\n            - `one`\n            - `one two three four five six`\n            - `--help`\n            - `one --help two`\n        3. `valgrind` should report no errors\n\n**Note: Permissive grading**\n\nThe provided tests for this MP do not test all features of the MP (intentionally: the goal of this MP is writing C, not writing robust code).\n\n# Submission and Grading\n\nSubmit on the submission site. Only submit `dll.c`; do not modify any other file.\n\n## Grading\n\nThis assignment is primarily a warm-up, graded fairly loosely. The score created by `make test` is the score you get on this MP.\n",
          "html": "<p>This is not a full MP; it is primarily testing your setup and ensuring you are ready for subsequent MPs.\nIt is <strong>dramatically easier</strong> than other MPs.\nDon't plan your time on other MPs based on this one.</p>\n<p>This MP has only one goal: to help you understand how C is unlike C++.</p>\n<p>We give you a C++ reference implementation of a doubly-linked list, with a simple driver program.\nWe also give you a C header file and driver program for a C version of the doubly-linked list.\nYour task is to write the corresponding doubly-linked list C source file.\nThis will mostly consist of copying C++ code to the C file, then changing the C++-specific parts to be C-specific instead.</p>\n<p><strong>Don't use AI</strong></p>\n<p>AI systems can do this assignment without any trouble. So can our TAs, others who took this course before, and many other people.</p>\n<p>Don't ask them to. Do this assignment yourself.</p>\n<p>This MP is primarily intended to help you understand C so that later MPs will be easier to do. If you have someone or something else do the MP for you, that learning won't happen and you'll find later MPs much harder as a consequence.</p>\n<p>You might find \"C without the ++\" to be a useful resource when working on this MP.</p>\n<h1>Initial Files</h1>\n<p><code>mp2.zip</code> contains a reference C++ implementation, a non-functioning C implementation, and build and testing supports like a Makefile and vscode project files.</p>\n<p>The provided <code>dll.c</code> <strong>does not compile</strong> because it does not define the functions required by <code>dll.h</code>. Our first recommended step below is to add enough that it does compile.</p>\n<p>The starter file does not include <code>stdio.h</code>, and you should not add it. Do not use any printing functions (such as <code>printf</code>) in your code. Instead, we recommend using the debugger. That lack of printing will be checked by <code>make test</code>, the command used to grade your code.</p>\n<h1>Machine Problem</h1>\n<p>Implement a C version of the provided C++ code.</p>\n<p>We recommend the following flow:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Stub out the implementation. That is, do the minimum possible to make it compile, generally by making empty or return-only function bodies.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Copy one function body from C++ to C and edit it to remove compiler errors. Pay particular attention to pointers and initialization: C++ calls initializers and destructors automatically which C does not.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Repeat until all functions are done.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Try it and debug it with the debugger.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>C you will need</h2>\n<p>You'll probably want to use <code>strlen</code>, <code>free</code>, and either <code>malloc</code> or <code>calloc</code>. Other functions defined in <code>string.h</code>, like <code>strcmp</code> and <code>memset</code>, are also permitted. The tests will verify that those are the only library functions that you use.</p>\n<p>You'll be required to meet all the rules of C. This will be enforced by compiling with the following compiler flags:</p>\n<p><strong>-Wall</strong>\n:   Enable all the warnings, even those that programmers often ignore.</p>\n<p><strong>-Werror</strong>\n:   Makes warnings into errors, refusing to compile if there are warnings.</p>\n<p><strong>-pedantic-errors</strong>\n:   Emit errors for things that the standard specifies but the compiler knows how to ignore.</p>\n<p><strong>-std=c17</strong>\n:   Uses the official 2017 standard version of C, the last version to be widely supported by compilers.</p>\n<p>You must not have any memory errors or leaks. This will be enforced in part using valgrind; the following invocation</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-sh\">valgrind --leak-check=full --show-leak-kinds=all ./dll_c whatever other arguments you want\n</code></pre>\n<p>must end with an \"ERROR SUMMARY\" reporting \"0 errors\" and no other error messages.</p>\n<h2>Guide to changing C++ into C</h2>\n<h3>Replace namespaces with name prefixes</h3>\n<p>In C++, namespaces help different libraries not collide. In C, the tradition is to prefix every function and global variable name with the same prefix, like <code>glViewport</code> instead of just <code>viewport</code> in OpenGL or <code>sqlite3_open</code> instead of <code>open</code> in SQLite.</p>\n<p>We use the prefix <code>dll</code> (double linked list) in our provided header file.</p>\n<h3>Replace overloads and templates with name suffixes</h3>\n<p>In C++, <code>foo(int)</code> and <code>foo(double)</code> can co-exist; in C they cannot. The traditional solution is to add a type-specific suffix to the function name, like <code>sqrt(double)</code> and <code>sqrtf(float)</code>.

          "raw": "\nIn this course we will use RMEs. RMEs specify what format the comments above a function should look like. This makes the code more readable and consistent. RME stands for Requires, Modifies, and Effects.\n\nREQUIRES: Indicates what you can assume about the preconditions and input to the function. You do not have to account for cases in your code that break the REQUIRES clause.\n\nMODIFIES: Indicates what parts of the program state outside of the function the function will modify. `cin` and `cout` are input/output streams which interact with the user. Using them in a function is considered changing the state outside of the function.\n\nEFFECTS: Indicates the intended actions the function performs and any outcomes.\n\nLet us look at a few examples!\n\n## Example 1\n\n```cpp\n//REQUIRES: b is not 0.\n//MODIFIES:\n//EFFECTS: Returns integer division of e divided by b.\nint Divide(int e, int b) {\n\treturn e/b;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, 'e' can be any value an int can be. However, 'b' can be any value except for 0. We don't have to write logic in the function to check for this. Since it is stated in the REQUIRES clause we can assume it is always true. Let us see an example where that is not the case,\n\n## Example 2\n\n```cpp\n//REQUIRES:\n//MODIFIES:\n//EFFECTS: Returns integer division of e divided by b. If b is 0 it returns 0.\nint Divide(int e, int b) {\n\tif(b == 0) return 0;\n\treturn e/b;\n}\n```\n\nIn this case, there is nothing in the REQUIRES clause so we need to account for the edge case in the code of if b is 0. There isn't a straightforward way to handle divide by 0 so it is specified in the EFFECTS what to do.\n\n## Example 3\n\n```cpp\n//REQUIRES: b is not 0.\n//MODIFIES: cin and cout\n//EFFECTS: Requests an int from the user and then divides it by b, printing out the answer as a double.\nvoid Divide(int b) {\n\tint e;\n\tcin >> e;\n\tcout << static_cast<double>(e)/b << endl;\n}\n```\n\nFor this function we modify the cin and cout streams in the function so it needs to be mentioned in the MODIFIES clause. Note in this case, we don't want to do integer division so we need to cast one of the ints to a double before dividing.\n",

VS Code is a powerful, free code editor that runs in the macOS, Windows, and Linux operating systems. To install VS Code, please follow the directions for your machine:\n\n- [Directions to install VS Code on macOS](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac)\n- [Directions to install VS Code on Windows](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)\n- [Directions to install VS Code on Linux](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux)\n\nShould you require assistance installing VS Code, please visit us during office hours before our first MP is released.\n\n### Install the required VS Code extensions\nThere are various extensions that we need you to install in VS Code. Please install the following extensions by navigating to their respective page(s) in the VS Code Marketplace, and clicking the green \"Install\" button located near the top of the page.\n\n[Dev Containers extension from Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)\n[Trouble installing an extension? Click here!](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace)\n\n## Step 2 - Install Docker Desktop\nWe will use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) this semester to run the CS 128 containerized development environment. To install Docker Desktop, please follow the directions for your machine:\n\n- [Directions to install Docker Desktop on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)\n- [Directions to install Docker Desktop on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/)\n- [Directions to install Docker Desktop on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)\n\nShould you require assistance installing Docker Desktop, please visit us during office hours so we can help get you up and running before our first MP is released.\n\n## Step 3 - Login to Docker Hub via Docker Desktop\nTo pull our the image for our development environment, you will need to:\n\nFirst, register for a Docker Hub account at [hub.docker.com/signup](https://app.docker.com/signup?), and\nOpen the Docker Desktop application, authenticate using the Sign in option in the top-right corner of the Docker Dashboard.\n\n## Step 4 - Connecting to, and working inside of, the development environment\n\nNow that we've set things up, it's time to introduce how to connect to the CS 128 development environment and author your solutions to programming problems. \nPlease carefully watch the video that follows provided by Prof. Nowak. \n\nNote in this section of CS 128 we will not connect to github and we will distribute starter code in other ways.\n\n[Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=583&v=zlVu5zkcbvE&embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fcs128.org%2F&embeds_referring_origin=https%3A%2F%2Fcs128.org&source_ve_path=MzY4NDIsMjg2NjY)\n\n### What if I don't see the open in dev container popup?\nIf the popup asking whether you want to open the folder in the dev container does not show up, you should:\n\n- Open the \"Command Palette\" (Ctrl Shift P for Windows/Linux or Command Shift P for Mac),\n- type \"Dev Containers: Reopen in Container\", and\n- select to execute that command (click it!).\n\n## Step 5 - Test it out!\n\nDownload the test files onto your computer by visiting this link,\n\n[Test Code](https://github.com/CS-128-Live/student-env-test/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)\n\nCreate a CS128 folder and unzip the downloaded zip file into the CS128 folder. Open up a new window of VS Code. Click \"Open...\" and navigate to the folder called \"student-env-test-main\". Click \"open\".\nMake sure to open the project in the docker container.\n\nTo compile and run the code type the following into the terminal window (more exact instructions will be with MP 1 and lab 2),\n\n```c\nmake exec\n./bin/exec\n```",

          "raw": "\nMost homework assignments, labs, and exams will use Prairie Learn's (PL) VS Code Workspaces. They are a way to compile and run code in an online environment similar to what you would do locally on your computer.\n\nBelow is a quick tutorial on how to use VS Code Workspaces on PL.\n\nFirst, open up the workspace by pressing the \"Open workspace\" button on the PL question.\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_1.png)\n\nThis will load (slowly) the workspace. When it is completely loaded it will look something like this,\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_2.png)\n\nOn the left there are the directories (folders) and files you will need and have access to for this question. In this case, there are three directories, bin, includes, and src and one file called Makefile.\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_3.png)\n\nIf you expand the directory (by clicking its name) you see the directories and files it contains. In this case, I clicked on src and then on the file named functions.cc. This opened functions.cc on the right.\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_4.png)\n\nC++ code is often broken up in header and source files. A header file will have class and function declarations (their name, return type, and parameters) while a source file will have their implementations (body/code). We will get into the details of why this is and how to compile C++ code later in the class.\n\nThe important takeaways are,\n\n- The includes directory has the header files. These are useful to look at to get a big picture idea of what functions you have and will need to write.\n- The src directory has the source files. This will include a file with a main function and other files where you will write your code.\n- The bin directory is where the computer will put the executable once it has compiled your code.\n\nC++ code needs to be compiled into an executable and then run as two separate steps. To make compiling your code easy we have provided a Makefile that allows you to run specific commands to easily compile your program.\n\nLet's walk through this step by step.\n\nFirst you need to open a terminal window. This will allow you to interact with the system that can compile and run your code.\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_5.png)\n\nThis will open up a terminal window on the bottom underneath your files. The \"coder@711efe7511ce:~ $ \" Indicates the terminal is ready for another written command.\n![](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_6.png)\n\nTo compile your code you will need to type,\nmake exec\nfollowed by the enter key. This will run the compilation command.\n\nNext, to run your code, you will type\n./bin/exec\nfollowed by the enter key. This will actually run the executable you just created. Any cout statements will print to the terminal and any cin statements will wait for you to type into the terminal a response.\n\nYou know the program is finished running because \"coder@711efe7511ce:~ $ \" has appeared again.\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_7.png)\n\nFor assignments and exams I recommend writing code and running it through the terminal on the VS code workspace as described before submitting to the autograder. This will tell you instantly if it compiles as well as if it produced the expected output. Remember when a C++ program runs it just executes the code in the main() function. To test your code in the workspace you will most likely need to edit the main() function to call the code you want to check. I will usually provide such an example to go off of.\n\n**Every time you make changes to the code you need to run the compilation command again (make exec) before running the executable (./bin/exec)**\n\nOnce your code is working as you'd like in the workspace, submit on the autograder. To do this, go back to the PL question tab and hit save and grade like normal. This will pull down the files you just wrote from the workspace into the autograder. The autograder will then give you feedback as normal.\n\n![enter image description here](https://www.cs128live.org/tutorials/wkspc_8.png)\n",
