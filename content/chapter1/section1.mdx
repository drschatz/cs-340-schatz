When running a C++ program the computer always looks for and runs a function called `main`.

```cpp
int main() { }
```

A function in C++ is formatted in a similar way than to Java or Kotlin!

First we have the return type, in this case it is an integer or `int`. Then we have the name of the function, in this case `main`. After the name are any parameters the function takes in, in this case none. Then in the curly braces is where the rest of the code goes! Like a statement that prints out "Hello World".

# Printing in C++

To print out values from your program in C++ involves a few steps.

First, we need to include the iostream library in our program. **A library is code someone else wrote that we can easily use.** This can be done with an include statement at the top of the file.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

We also need to tell the program we are using code from the standard library. We can do this by adding the following,

```cpp
using namespace std;
```

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
cout << "Hello World" << endl;
}
```

**OUTPUT:** Hello World

`cout` is a type of stream which has values inserted into it with the insertion operators `<<`. The program will then print the contents of the cout stream to the terminal.

`endl` puts a newline in the stream and prints the contents of the stream to the terminal right away.

The following example shows how you can chain insertion operators to feed multiple things into cout.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
cout << "Hello World " << 4 << "eva" << endl;
}
```

**OUTPUT:** Hello World 4eva
